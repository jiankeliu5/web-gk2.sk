TREZOR is the first hardware wallet providing security for your bitcoins by virtue of its design while retaining convenience of use. No matter whether you're a beginner or a security-paranoid geek.

TREZOR is basically a small computer. It is designed to protect your private keys from possible online and offline risks. In order to do this, TREZOR keeps the private keys away from the Internet and confirms the transactions in-device. That way you can always check the screen for the right address, amount and transaction fee before sending your bitcoins.

###Jller/Ignorance (2015)

*Art collaboration with Prokop Bartonicek and Tomislav Arnaudov as [pebe/lab](http://www.pebe.cz/) and Benjamin Maus ([FELD](http://www.feld.is/))*

Ignorance responds to current trends in mass production - the speed, efficiency and low cost. These apparent benefits have obviously impact on the ecology, the authors, however, are most interested in the impact on the culture - weakening the knowledge, forgetting the original manufacturing techniques and crafts. Hunt for low-cost production diminishes the ability to manually operate and work together - to create value. These tendencies have their essential contribution to the degree of "ignorance" and disinterest of individuals about their environment, forms of living and culture.

###[Complex Harmonic Motion](http://www.pebe.cz/lab/?p=3788) (2014)

*Art collaboration with Prokop Bartonicek and Tomislav Arnaudov as [pebe/lab](http://www.pebe.cz/)*

Installation is a combination of old visual mechanism with the latest light technology, using optical discoveries of professor Jules Lissajous, who first described complex harmonic motion by using simple curves and equations.

In this project the harmonic motion is generated by large pendulum which "draws" using a beam of UV laser on a phosphor projection screen placed underneath it. This strong UV beam charges the phosphor surface that subsequently emits the energy in the form of visible structures, compositions and images.

###[49° 56.822, 15° 15.870](http://www.pebe.cz/lab/?p=3765) (2014)

Bartoníček's exhibition entitled '49° 56.822, 15° 15.870' (taken from the coordinates of where it's located) is a three-part site-specific project put together specially for the unique spaces of the Gallery of the Central Bohemian Gallery – specifically for the Baroque pharmacy and the spa room of the Jesuit College. All three pieces are poised on the boundary between technological research and conceptual art. The main installation uses a UV laser projector whose construction the artist made himself – the rays of light reflecting off the rippled water's surface draw abstract structures on a phosphorescent surface. The second work involves the classical technique of screenprinting, combining a traditional printmaking form with the current phenomenon of generative graphics. Using a simple flash of light, the third piece 'records' a momentary image of viewers' faces in their own retinas, raising questions about the delicate borderline between the image of reality and an idea conjured by the human mind.

###[Phosphor 360 ver. B](http://www.pebe.cz/lab/?p=3737) (2013)

The Phosphor 360 ver. B installation is a prototype of a new visual mechanism connecting laser projection, mapping and generative motion graphics with an energy accumulating material. Japanese artist and production engineer Daito Manabe tested a UV laser on a phosphor coated projection surface. P360B also uses a UV laser projector, but it is mounted on a 360° rotating head making it possible to cover selected areas. Real-time generated graphic is projected on objects located nearby. A strong UV beam charges the phosphor-coated surface of the geometric objects that radiate energy in the form of visible structures, compositions and images

###[Mirrsaic NOW](http://www.pebe.cz/lab/?p=3744) (2012)

*Art collaboration with Prokop Bartonicek as [pebe/lab](http://www.pebe.cz/)*

In an urban scene we can see solar reflections of geometric forms. Abstract composition described by the sun is approaching from above towards the ground. After several hours, the shapes overlap, thus creating a powerful light cluster, which is changing very fast in an interlocking inscription. Individual light fragments at the moment of encounter rendering the word "NOW" which accurately captures the transience of the moment.

Today, the availability of efficient design and lighting technologies, mapping and generative art is often oblivious to the basic rules of light, time and space. I decided to create a impressive public space light installation that would work within the elementary principles.

Mirrsaic, as a process and a tool was programmed, generated and manufactured using the most modern techniques and technologies, which are not directly seen by the viewer. The most complicated project tool is hidden; it remains just a wall, a daylight system and several mirrors in the exact shape, the exact place at the exact time.

###[Ignorance](http://richardjanecek.com/ignorance) (2012)

*Art collaboration with Richard Janecek*

{% for i in (1..2) %}
![book{{ i }}](/assets/book{{ i }}.jpg)
{% endfor %}

A book with plain pages stands on a pedestal. When someone approaches it, the text slowly appears on its pages. When a page is turned, the book reacts by showing different contents respecting the direction of a page flip. After the person walks away, the book again returns to its original empty form.

The work being a collaboration with Richard Janecek was featured in the National Technical Library (NTK) Gallery in Prague. It uses Kinect and a digital projector to achieve the mentioned effect, so similarly to iaMap Sandbox the technology stays well hidden from the spectator. On every approach the book is opened to a random page and there is a possibility to have a library of books so each time the displayed book is picked randomly as well.

###[Videofeedback](https://github.com/prusnak/videofeedback) (2012)

{% for i in (1..6) %}

Interactive video-feedback VJing software. A camera is pointed to the computer screen, its picture is modified by a chain of custom made visual filters, which is then shown again on the very same screen. This feedback creates a complex chaotic system of colorful visuals.

The project uses OpenCV for retrieving the camera stream, which is later rendered using OpenGL and an advanced pixel-shader. The behavior of this shader is controlled by an attached MIDI controller, which in combination with a movable camera provides an easy and intuitive way how to interact with the process that generates the images. Audio can also be used to change the filter parameters resulting in visuals that react to volume and/or frequency of the recorded sound.

###[SVG-edit](https://github.com/svg-edit/svgedit) (since 2009)
