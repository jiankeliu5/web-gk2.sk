Ignorance responds to current trends in mass production - the speed, efficiency and low cost. These apparent benefits have obviously impact on the ecology, the authors, however, are most interested in the impact on the culture - weakening the knowledge, forgetting the original manufacturing techniques and crafts. Hunt for low-cost production diminishes the ability to manually operate and work together - to create value. These tendencies have their essential contribution to the degree of "ignorance" and disinterest of individuals about their environment, forms of living and culture.
