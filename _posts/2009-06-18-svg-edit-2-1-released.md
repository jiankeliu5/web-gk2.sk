title: SVG-edit 2.1 released
---

Thanks to hard work of Jeff, Narendra, Vidar and me, we managed to create today a 2.1 release of [SVG-edit](http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/). Interesting changes include:

* tooltips for all UI elements
* editing of fill, stroke and group opacity
* selecting and moving elements
* saving SVG file
* adding end editing of text elements
* context panel for tools
* change rectangle radius
* controlling of the editor with keyboard shortcuts

You can try the 2.1 branch [here](http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/branches/2.1/editor/svg-editor.html)

Unfortunately the editor still has some problems when embedded into [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com/), but now that Vidar received his invitation, I hope we'll be able to fix it sooner. :-) We are also already cooking new features for 2.2 so stay tuned!
