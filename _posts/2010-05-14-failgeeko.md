Today morning I was working on some packages in openSUSE Build Service when suddenly OSC started to throw 403/503 error messages. I went to [http://build.opensuse.org/](http://build.opensuse.org/) site to see this:

{% img center /content/outage.png %}

Then it occurred to me - it would be much better if we had some funny image on this page to cheer user up, something like [twitter failwhale](http://franciemedia.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/twitter_fail_whale.jpg) or the one [Jimmac made for SUSE Studio](http://jimmac.musichall.cz/log/?p=798). I started Inkscape and after a couple of minutes I created this one:

{% img center /content/failgeeko.png %}

I know it is far from perfect (I'm no artist), but feel free to grab the [original SVG](/content/failgeeko.svg) and create a better one! We'll include it in the 2.0 release of Build Service which will be using Bento theme by Robert. :-)
