title: openSUSE Counter for Facebook
---

[Gnokii](http://karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/) pointed me to [Ubuntu countdown](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/04/ubuntu-countdown-banner-for-your.html) banner for Facebook and asked me if I could rework it to show [openSUSE Counter](http://countdown.opensuse.org/) instead. Unfortunately I was not able to reuse the code because it was written in Python as a plugin for Google AppEngine and I wanted something lightier. After some time I was able to come up with my own simple solution in PHP. :-)

Here are the steps for you:

1. login to [Facebook](http://facebook.com/)
2. go to [http://apps.facebook.com/opensuse-counter](http://apps.facebook.com/opensuse-counter)
3. application will ask for permission to access your profile, to accept click **Allow** {% img /content/fbcounter1.png %}
4. click **Add to Profile** on the following page {% img /content/fbcounter2.png %}
5. click **Add** to confirm your choice {% img /content/fbcounter3.png %}
6. you'll be taken to your profile page where you click **Keep** {% img /content/fbcounter4.png %}
7. enjoy openSUSE counter on your Facebook profile! :-)

**Update:** When the counter seems to be stuck on 43 days, just remove and re-add the profile box.
