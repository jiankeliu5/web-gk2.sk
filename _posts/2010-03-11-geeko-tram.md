title: Geeko Tram
---

Almost exactly 3 months ago I blogged about a [Geeko Bus](/geeko-bus/). What a surprise I had today when I saw a tram decorated in a very similar fashion. The weird thing is, that both bus 183 and tram 8 have their stops near our Prague offices. There is definitely something fishy going on! :-D

I was even able to find a video on Youtube, so you know it is not shopped. :-)
