title: Netflix Content by Country
---

Beginning of January Netflix expanded to most of the countries all around the world. The [domination map](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/14164) looks quite impressive:

Unfortunately, the reality is not as bright as it looks. When I read the announcement, I did not hesitate and subscribed the service. I was very disappointed to see that most of my favorite shows were not available in my country and I immediately cancelled my subscription.

Later, I stumbled upon a website that maintains the list of Netflix content per country called [uNoGS](http://unogs.com/countrydetail/) (unofficial Netflix online Global Search). I was very interested to see how my country stands when compared to the others. Sadly there was no visualization of uNoGS data on their site, so I came up with my own using the interactive [Google Charts API](https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart):

**Update:** There is a service called [TVUnblock](https://tvunblock.com/) which makes US content available to non-US people like me by just switching DNS servers to theirs (no malware installation required), so my subscription is live again. Yay!
