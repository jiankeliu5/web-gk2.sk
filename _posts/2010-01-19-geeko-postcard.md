title: Geeko Postcard
---

Today I had a very nice surprise laying on my office desk. It was a postcard from my dear friends from Brno (so called [#fedora-cs](irc://irc.freenode.net/fedora-cs) mafia :-D) depicting a 3D image of a geeko on sand. Luckily I was able to find two shops ([here](http://www.mapcards.net/?page=products&id=62) and [here](http://ikarakorum.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=317_320&products_id=4387)) which offer this jewel. The latter one also had the 3D picture so I can share this viewing pleasure with you:

It looks even better in real-life! :-)
