title: Avatars in openSUSE Build Service
---

Thanks to [Tom](http://digitalflow.de/) we now have avatars in openSUSE [Build Service](http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service), so e.g. Involved Users list looks like this:

{% img center /content/involved-users.png %}

If you have a shady man instead of your nice photo, go to [gravatar.com](http://gravatar.com/) and setup your own one. Don't forget to add the email address you are using in the Build Service!
