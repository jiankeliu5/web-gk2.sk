title: What I Am Up To
---

I realized that I haven't put any new posts for quite a long time.
Here, I try to summarize what I am up to now and what are the projects
I'm currently working on.

One area of my activities is related to Bitcoin. It is an
exciting way how to transfer value over the Internet and
you can read more about it on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)
or on [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/).
With Marek "slush" Palatinus we are building a hardware wallet
for Bitcoins called [Trezor](http://trezor.bitcoin.cz/).
We found out that one of the biggest problems of mass addoption
of Bitcoin is that it's very hard to keep your private keys secure.
With our solution the keys never leave the keychain wallet,
so it is impossible for attacker to steal them. We have couple of other
ideas which deal with Bitcoins, but right now we focus on Trezor and we will
announce these other Bitcoin related projects once Trezor is out.

Another field is software, hardware and small fabrication
consulting effort called [fabhack](http://fabhack.com/). We founded it together
with Tomislav "sargon" Arnaudov, whom I met at Prague hackerspace
[brmlab](http://brmlab.cz/). At first we wanted to start something inspired by
a western [fablab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fablab) model,
but we realised that our knowledge is the most valuable asset and
easy access to makers' technology can be provided by some other groups.
At fabhack we try to do projects that are both bleeding edge and fun to make!

During countless nights spent at brmlab we met a famous artist
[Prokop Bartonicek](http://www.prokopbartonicek.com/)
whom we helped to realize a couple of art projects.
Later we decided to create a studio that deals with interactive art
installations and hi-tech exclusive objects called [pebe/lab](http://pebe.cz/lab/).
This is a very exciting cooperation for all of us and we are really
looking forward to our contracts.

As you can see I'm quite busy with these three enterprises.
I decided to give away some of my older ideas
for projects, because I'm afraid I will not have a chance to get back to them.
See my next blogpost called [Idea Factory](http://stick.gk2.sk/2013/02/idea-factory/)
for more information.
