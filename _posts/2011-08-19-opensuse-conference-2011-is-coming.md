title: openSUSE Conference 2011 is coming ...

... and I'll be there again as well! I guess there's no need to tell I am really looking forward to it.

I'm pretty excited when I look closer at the just published [Conference Timetable](http://conference.opensuse.org/timetable). What I really like about the openSUSE Conference is that it has also sessions that are not directly related to SUSE or Linux in general. You can "geek out" about topics like [Digital processing of early color photography](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=58&confId=2), [Open Street Map](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=117&confId=2), [8-bit Music](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=148&confId=2), [Wooden kayaks](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=11&confId=2) or [Open Hardware and Hackerspaces](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=24&confId=2). The last one will be held by me and I'll try to bring a functional [Rep Rap 3d printer](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa) from our [Prague hackerspace brmlab](http://brmlab.cz/) so you can see it in action and print your own 3d models. All in the spirit of our motto: Have a lot of fun!

Together with [Henne](http://hennevogel.de/) and [Tom](http://www.digitalflow.de/blog/) we'll hold a [workshop](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=99&confId=2) about our social networking platform called [Connect](http://connect.opensuse.org/) and we hope we'll get more contributors to it.

Among the talks I mentioned I also plan to visit sessions about [GNOME 3](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=31&confId=2), [tmux](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=3&confId=2), [5Ws of Contributions](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=79&confId=2), [Static Code Checking](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=64&confId=2) and [Lightning Talks](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=134&confId=2). And of course don't miss the keynotes and social event [The Geek](http://conference.opensuse.org/indico/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=137&confId=2) in Wild West theme!

See you all there!
