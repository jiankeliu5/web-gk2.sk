title: image_url function in Ruby on Rails
---

If you need to get the full URL of an image, just put the following code snippet into `ApplicationHelper` module in your `app/helpers/application_helper.rb`:

:::ruby
      def image_url(source)
        abs_path = image_path(source)
        unless abs_path =~ /^http/
          abs_path = "#{request.protocol}#{request.host_with_port}#{abs_path}"
        end
       abs_path
      end

I wonder why this function is not already a standard part of Rails.
