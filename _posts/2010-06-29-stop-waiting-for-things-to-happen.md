Today I stumbled upon this image:

{% img center /content/happen.jpg %}

I thought this is exactly the motto openSUSE needs right now so I created this one:

{% img center /content/opensuse-happen.png %}

(Feel free to enhance, [XCF file](/content/opensuse-happen.xcf.gz) for Gimp is [here](/content/opensuse-happen.xcf.gz).)
