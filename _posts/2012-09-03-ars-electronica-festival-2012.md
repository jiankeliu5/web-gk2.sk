title: Ars Electronica Festival 2012
---

Last week I attended [Ars Electronica](http://www.aec.at/) Festival with an additional title "[The Big Picture](http://www.aec.at/thebigpicture/en)". This was quite a new experience for me, because I usually visit technical conferences, while this one was more about art (but tech was of course present as well!).

The first evening in Linz I decided to spend with folks from hackerspace Linz called [DevLoL](http://devlol.org/). Technically, it's not a hackerspace yet, because they are still waiting for their premises, but once they get them, it's gonna be great! They are promised around 1000 square meters of space in a former tobacco factory, now a culture centrum called [Tabakfabrik](http://www.tabakfabrik-linz.at/). Hopefully they'll be able to do some amazing projects there soon. We had a great discussion about stuff we do at [brmlab](http://brmlab.cz/) and I got some valuable input as well. It's always nice to see more and more hackerspaces to appear in new places.

The other days were mostly about Ars Electronica. I attended quite a lot of expositions, talks and events. If you've never been to [Ars Electronica Center](http://www.aec.at/), go there, their main exposition is amazing and the tickets are quite cheap (8 EUR full price).

During the festival these two projects caught my eye: [CogniToo](http://cognitoo.com/) and [BioBookCover](http://biobookcover.com). The first one is basically a tattoo of your [fMRI scan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fMRI). The times when people were tattoing the names of their loved ones are past, the future is having a fMRI scan of your brain while thinking about your love. :-) The second one is an attempt to create biodegradable (starch based) plastic, which can be made in amateur environment (like a kitchen) and will dissolve in few days (in contrast to few centuries) in nature if thrown away.

From the talks I mostly enjoyed the talk from [Golan Levin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Levin). He started with the following image:

I think it's really a good way how to describe current efforts in technology. He didn't said that explicitly, but my opinion is that artists are leaning towards interesting-beautiful side and hackers towards useful-interesting side of things. There are also other groups like for example designers, which are positioned somewhere else in the triangle. Golan showed us some examples of interesting-beautiful projects like: [Most Wanted and Least Wanted Paintings](http://awp.diaart.org/km/painting.html) by Komar Melamid, [Every Playboy Centerfold](http://salavon.com/work/EveryPlayboyCenterfoldDecades/) by Jason Salavon or [The Secret Lives of Numbers](http://www.turbulence.org/Works/nums/) by himself.

Other nice talks I attended were about about [Free Universal Construction Kit](http://fffff.at/free-universal-construction-kit/) and [Apertus](http://apertus.org/), an open source camera. It's nice to see that an idea of open-source hardware is advancing in these more-or-less artistic fields as well.

But undoubtedly, the main attraction of the festival were so called [Klangwolke](http://www.aec.at/klangwolke/en/) (Sound clouds). This is a tradition that happens on the bank of Danube river every year and this time there were around 90000 participating people. Around one thousand of them used an opportunity to make a big blinking letter during the festival and these were connected via network during the performance. The letters were not the only things blinking, we also had a chance to see buildings with projections and 50 quadcopters flying changing colour and flying in nice formations. See the video for yourself:

I'd like to thank all people I hanged out with (especially [Prokop](http://www.prokopbartonicek.com/) who made the trip possible and [Szara](https://twitter.com/szarasophie) who kindly sheltered me) and I hope I'll be able to visit the event next year as well!
