Yesterday we were replacing old chairs in our Prague SUSE office with the brand new ones. We got a wicked idea to stack the older ones into the Boosters' Office and have a virtual bus ride for a few minutes. Our colleague Michal Kubecek and his camera were ready as usual so he quickly took a photo of us enjoying the ride:

Later I had some time to practice my 1337 GIMP skillz and created a motivational poster for your viewing pleasure. After [Geeko Bus](/geeko-bus/) and [Geeko Tram](/geeko-tram/) I give you without further ado the "openSUSE Spacebus!":
