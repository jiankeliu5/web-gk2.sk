title: openSUSE 11.0 Countdown
---

It all started with my mail to [opensuse mailing list](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse/2008-04/msg00196.html):

> "I found out that Ubuntu has nice way to promote their new release - small banner which informs how many days are left before new version is out. See http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/countdown for details. This banner also links to information page about distribution features and _mainly_ to beta releases which can attract more testers. I think it would be nice if openSUSE had something similar. I would created it by myself but unfortunately I don't have time right now."

The same day I received beautiful design from Billy Juliani, added some PHP magic into it and together we created countdown buttons for openSUSE 11.0. The result can be seen here: [http://en.opensuse.org/Countdown](http://en.opensuse.org/Countdown)
