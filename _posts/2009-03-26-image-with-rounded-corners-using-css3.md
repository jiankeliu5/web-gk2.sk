title: Image with rounded corners (using CSS3)
---

W3C added nice [new options for creating rounded corners](http://www.css3.info/preview/rounded-border/) of elements to their [CSS3 working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/). Engines like [Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko), [KHTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML) and [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) already implemented these functions, but they use vendor prefixes in the keywords (`-moz-border-radius`, `-khtml-border-radius` and `-webkit-border-radius` respectively), because the feature is not yet fully standardized. That's also the reason why Opera and Internet Explorer decided not to implement this extension for now.

I was playing with the rounded corners and I like this feature a lot, but I also hit one problem (in all 3 engines). When you use the `border-radius` with an `img` element, the image is drawn above the border, so it isn't rounded (top example). Fortunately, the effect could be easily achieved by rounded `div`, setting its dimensions exactly to the image size and using the image as the `div`'s background (bottom example).

!(/content/rounded1.jpg)

:::html
    <img style="border: 2px solid black;
                border-radius: 30px;
                -moz-border-radius: 30px;
                -khtml-border-radius: 30px;
                -webkit-border-radius: 30px;"
                src="presov.jpg" />

!(/content/rounded2.jpg)

:::html
    <div style="border: 2px solid black;
                border-radius: 30px;
                -moz-border-radius: 30px;
                -khtml-border-radius: 30px;
                -webkit-border-radius: 30px;
                width: 180px;
                height: 240px;
                background: url('presov.jpg');" />

**Update#1:** I reported the issue to [Gecko](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=485501), [KHTML](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188242) and [WebKit](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24880) bugzillas.

**Update#2:** Dave Hyatt closed the WebKit bug with the comment: "This was fixed recently." \o/
