This is the question lot of bitcoin owners are asking themselves. We believe Bitcoin does not belong just to the online world, but has also its place in everyday real world situations. Many bitcoiners want to spend their coins in a restaurant or support a local service provider and bitcoin accepting businesses need to be discovered and located easily. That is why Coinmap came to life.
